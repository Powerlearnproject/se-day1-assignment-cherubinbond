# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
writing code for computers
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is writing codes for computers, it is important because it helps to simplify complicated tasks 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
*introduction of programming languages
*better memory
*good computing power


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning, coding, testing


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
*software developer: codes and creates software
*quality assurance engineer: ensures that the code runs smoothly and does not have any errors
*project manager: ensures that a software development runs smoothly 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
computer bugs , it can be overcome by testing the code continously

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
